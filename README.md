heatboard for use with faustus
==============================

This is a simple bash script that makes your keyboard a visual thermal sensor.

I made this in my spare time in about an hour and want to share it with you all. Hopefully you find it useful :)

The service script is just for Void you can put it in a new folder called thermalboard in /etc/sv and enable it from there.

I may make it a package if it receives enough demand.
